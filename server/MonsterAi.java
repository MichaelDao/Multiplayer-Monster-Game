/*
 * This is my plan
 * Create a model / graph that consists of vertices and edges
 * with that, you will place the player and monster piece onto
 * different sections around the network. With this implemented,
 * there will be a possibility for Dijkstra’s algorithm to work as it should
 * 
 * Using this link as a reference:
